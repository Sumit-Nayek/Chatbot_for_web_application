# Chatbot for Web Application

A simple LLM-based chatbot with an interactive user interface.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains code for a basic conversational chatbot application. It's built using a large language model (LLM) backend and a frontend interface, allowing users to input queries / messages and get responses in real time.

---

## 🧰 Features

* Interactive UI for chatting with the LLM.
* Backend integration to process user messages and generate responses.
* Easily extensible (you can swap in different LLM models, customize prompts, etc.).
* Lightweight and easy to run for testing and prototyping.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Dependencies

* Python
* Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`
* (Optionally) any UI library or framework you use (if this is a web app, maybe Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit etc.)

---

---

## 📝 Usage

* Type your query / message in the input field.
* The backend processes your message (via the LLM) and returns a response.
* Use this to test conversation flows, prompt variations, or integration setups.

---

## 🚧 Limitations & Future Improvements

* Current implementation is minimal—no support yet for

  * user authentication
  * conversation history persistence
  * advanced prompt engineering or context preservation
  * UI/UX polish (styling, design, etc.)
* Potential enhancements:

  * Memory of past messages so the bot can “remember” context across turns
  * Richer UI (with avatars, formatting, etc.)
  * Support for multiple LLM backends (open source and commercial)
  * Deployment & scalability (Dockerization, cloud hosting)

---

## 🔐 Disclaimer

This is a prototype / testing module. Behavior depends heavily on the underlying LLM; it may produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. Use cautiously if you intend to build it towards production.
